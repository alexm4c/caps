# CAPS

A conference audio processing system

These python scripts are designed to streamline the processing of raw audio files recorded at a conference or forum.
It comprises of two main modules, collect.py and process.py. The primary function of collect.py is to prompt the user
through a terminal ui to describe the audio metadata, such as title, speakers, and which audio segments to cut. 
The second module, process.py, will then use the output of collect.py to write the metadata to the file, cut it into
it's relevent segments, and then optimize the audio for listening.
